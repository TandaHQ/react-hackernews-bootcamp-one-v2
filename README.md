# react-hackernews-bootcamp-one-v2

Sup!

Throughout the bootcamp we will be working through learning some of the core concepts of building applications in react and react-native, by building a news feed for the popular [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

### Prerequisites

Please have node and yarn already installed on your computer.
  - [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

> In regards to IDE/text editor, use what you like! However, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will be the officially supported text editor üëç.

## Getting started

To get started you will need to install all the development/application dependencies. To do this, simply run `yarn` on you command line in the root directory of the project. Then, to start the development server, you can run `yarn start`.

## Chapters

The bootcamp is split into chapters. To start a chapter you need to check out the branch. this can be done by running `git checkout <chapter-name>`. When you checkout a chapter, there will be a new readme listed in the chapters directory, and the current source code will be updated to contain everything from the excercises in the previous chapters.

| Chapter       | Content                |
|---------------|------------------------|
| chapter-zero  | My First Element       |
| chapter-one   | What is JSX            |
| chapter-two   | Component Architecture |
| chapter-three | Modules & Styles       |
| chapter-four  | Views                  |
| chapter-five  | Containers             |
| chapter-six   | API Integrations       |
| chapter-seven | Controlled Inputs      |
| chapter-eight | Native                 |
| chapter-nine  | Native Styles          |
| chapter-ten   | Native Primitives      |
| chapter-last  | Port The Rest          |

If you would like to keep using your own code from chapter to chapter you can use the branch called `all-chapters`. this will give you all the chapter's readme files with none of the example code.

## Excercises

Throughout the bootcamp there will be excercises, these are mandatory for building the application, however the 'additional excercies' are purely for learning and do not contribute towards building the hackernews app.

## Let's Begin

Run `git checkout chapter-zero` or `git checkout all-chapters` in the root of the repository to start.
